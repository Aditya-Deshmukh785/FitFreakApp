# 💪 FitFreak - Your Personal Fitness Companion

Welcome to **FitFreak**, a full-stack Java-based web application designed to make fitness and diet planning accessible, personalized, and motivating for everyone — whether you're aiming to gain weight, lose it, or train like Goku 💥.

## 📌 About the Project

FitFreak started as a vision during the COVID-19 lockdown, when our creator — a certified gym trainer — noticed the need for digital fitness solutions. With over 5 years of offline experience and a successful gym in Yavatmal, Maharashtra, FitFreak was born to bring that same transformation online.

This platform guides users through a journey of fitness by offering personalized plans, BMI tracking, diet charts, and an admin dashboard for backend data access.
