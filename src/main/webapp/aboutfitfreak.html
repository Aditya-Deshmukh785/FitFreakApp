        <h1>About FitFreak</h1>
        <div class="underline"></div>

        <p>
            FitFreak was born out of passion and purpose. It all began during the <span class="highlight">2020 lockdown</span>, when gyms were closed, and staying fit became a real challenge. Our founder, a certified gym trainer from <span class="location">Yavatmal, Maharashtra</span>, realized how many people were struggling to stay consistent and motivated from home.
        </p>

        <p>
            What started as a few virtual fitness sessions quickly grew into a full-blown online platform. With over <span class="highlight">5 years of hands-on training experience</span>, the vision was simple — to bring expert-guided fitness plans to everyone, no matter where they are.
        </p>

        <p>
            From personalized diet charts to smart workout splits, FitFreak has grown into a trusted name in the fitness community. We believe that fitness isn't just a goal — it's a lifestyle. Today, along with our online platform, we proudly run an offline gym in <span class="location">Yavatmal, Maharashtra</span>, where the FitFreak journey first began.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whether you're starting out or pushing your limits — <span class="highlight">FitFreak is here to guide, transform, and elevate your fitness journey</span>.
        </p>
